          Elsewhere is a multi-room music venue, nightclub, and arts space in
          Bushwick, Brooklyn. Our focus is underground and unbound music,
          presented with love. Since 2017, Elsewhereâ€™s three stories of
          dancefloors and stages have been home to expansive sonic offerings for
          all New Yorkers to explore. We are and will forever remain fiercely
          independent.
